🚀 Graph Algorithms Project
This project implements fundamental graph algorithms using NetworkX, including BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, and graph visualization.

📌 Tasks
Transport Network Graph – Create and analyze a weighted graph.
Pathfinding with BFS & DFS – Compare different search strategies.
Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Find the shortest paths between cities.

Task 1: Transport Network Graph
This task models a real-world transport network as a weighted graph.

✅ Features:

Defines a graph with cities as nodes and routes as weighted edges.
Visualizes the transport network using matplotlib.
Computes key graph properties (number of nodes, edges, degrees).
Finds shortest paths using NetworkX.

Task 2: BFS vs DFS Pathfinding
This task implements BFS and DFS to find paths in an unweighted graph.

✅ Features:

DFS (Depth-First Search) – explores depth-first, leading to longer paths.
BFS (Breadth-First Search) – guarantees the shortest path.
Comparison of search results.

DFS goes deep first, while BFS finds the shortest path in terms of edges.

This task applies Dijkstra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path between all cities.

✅ Features:

Uses priority queue (heapq) for efficiency.
Computes shortest paths between all nodes.
Reconstructs paths to show the actual routes taken.
